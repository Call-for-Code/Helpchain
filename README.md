# Helpchain, your donation with trust and transparency

Helpchain is an easy-to-use mobile application providing transparency for people all over the world to help the victims of disasters. Helpchain uses a variety of IBM Cloud services, including IBM Blockchain Platform. The application enables tracking of transactions, fundraising and NGO expenditures audit for all parties involved.

The application has 2 feeds: one with real-time disaster alerts, showing the location and number of people that could be affected, and another to track locations that are already receiving donations. Finally, the user can select in the donation field the detail of the disasters and the NGOs involved to make a donation. Once it's placed, the user can track where the donation is being used.

Code and documentation is in the process of being transferred. Watch this repository for updates on progress.
